# Pandemic-Card-Deck-Tracker
Small application for keeping track of upcoming infection cards, so maybe we can win a game for once...

Current Features:
- shows upcoming cards in the infection deck.
- only shows the list after the first epidemic is hit.

Feature Requests:
- show discard pile details
- add list of all possible cards. so we know which is most likely
- make it easier to enter drawn cards. maybe a list of buttons we can just click.
- enter posible cards list, use to calculate possiblity, use to select drawn card instead of typing.
